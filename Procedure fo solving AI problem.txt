Procedure for solving AI problem

1. Loading and checking the data
- Load data
- Detect outlier
  for numerical feature
- Join train and test date set

2. Feature analysis
   verify correlation among features and correlation between each feature and the output
- Analyze numerical values
- Analyze categorical values

3. Filling missing values

4. Feature engineering
   create new features

5. Changing feature representation 
   categorical to "0 and 1"

6. Modeling
- Define model
  neural network, decision tree, SVM
- Train the model
- Plot learning curve
- Check crossvalidation
- Tune the hyperparameters
  gridsearch or genetic algorithm

7. Prediction
